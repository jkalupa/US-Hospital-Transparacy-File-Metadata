Subject: 2021 Pricing Transparency File

Msg:
Hi <hospital or system> Staff,

I'm a software developer studying US healthcare pricing and I'm looking for the location of your machine readable file of procedures and payer negotiated rates, as described in 45 CFR § 180.40 (a). Where is this hosted on your site?

Thanks,
John
