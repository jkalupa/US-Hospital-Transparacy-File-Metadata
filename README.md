# US Hospital Transparacy File Metadata
Starting on 1/1/2021 [45 CFR § 180.40 (a)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/27/2019-24931/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2020-hospital-outpatient-pps-policy-changes-and-payment-rates-and#p-1008) requires that every US hospitals a provide publicly accessible machine readable file with procedure pricing information, see [45 CFR § 180.50](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/27/2019-24931/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2020-hospital-outpatient-pps-policy-changes-and-payment-rates-and#p-1010) for data elements. This project aims to document the locations of these files for use elsewhere.

See transparency_file_locations.csv for data.

This file is provided as is with no guarantee of accuracy.

I will attempt differentiate states where a file is not hosted for some reason.

My working system is:
Unknown - null
Does not need to post a file - exempt
Has not posted a file - non-complaint

### Formatting
Gathering this information will be a largely manually process and while the final file will be .csv, as described above, it will be manually generated in LibreOffice. If you have issues parsing this file or suggests for additional alternative formats create an issue or better yet a pull request.

### Contact Logging
In the Contacts folder I will store a record of hospitals and organizations I've messaged for information.

### Contributing
As of 1/10/2021 US government estimates there 7596 hospitals in the US. Any help gathering this information is appreciated.
